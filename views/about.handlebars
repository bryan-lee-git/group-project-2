        <p>The four of us are students at the University of Utah's Coding Boot-camp. This is our second project together. We are 
          always trying to push ourselves to use what we've learned in new and creative ways. As our name suggests one of our major goals is to enjoy the process of creating great apps. After the success with out first
          group project, the <a target="blank" href="http://a1-guitar.com/landing.html">A1-Guitar</a> Leaner App, we wanted a 
          different kind of challenge. As we tried to conjure another award winning idea, it became evident that we should create
          a game. Where A1 was largely meant to be utilitarian, this project was intended to entertain.

        <p>When we settled on the concept of an RPG; one member, Jim, quickly made it known that he didn't care for the traditional
          systems in other RPG's. So with the moniker "I really hate hit points!" in mind, we went about the job a creating something 
          fresh! We spent hours ironing out the details; imagining and re-imagining different ways the game mechanics would interact
          with each other. What came out of this melding of the minds was a system where no mechanic existed in isolation. A system
          where the user had to think about not only their own strategy, but their opponents as well. We wanted players to have to be cognizant of 
          how their available resources of speed, stamina, and strength would determine both their strategy and the AI's. With the addition
          of weapons and armor we added another layer of tactical challenge; all without hit points. We'd like to wish you good luck on your path to Rome, we hope
          you have as much fun playing our app as we did creating it!
