        <h4>Our Desire To Reinvent the RPG</h4>

        <p>The four of us are students at the University of Utah/Trilogy Education Coding Bootcamp (Cohort: July 2018 - January 2019). This is our second group project together as the Panda Warriors. Our group's overarching goal is to push ourselves to use what we've learned in new, exciting, and creative ways. As our name suggests, we make it a priority to really enjoy the development process and have fun while creating BEAUTIFUL apps. After the success of our first group project, the <a target="blank" href="http://a1-guitar.com/landing.html">A1-Guitar Learner App</a>, we wanted a different kind of challenge. As we tried to conjure another award winning idea, it became evident that we should create an interactive game. Where the A1 Guitar Learner was largely meant to be utilitarian and helpful, <em>this project was intended to entertain.</em>

        <p>When we settled on the concept of an RPG game, Jim quickly made it known that he didn't care for the traditional battle systems out there. So with the phrase "I really hate hit points!" in mind, we went about the job of creating something fresh! We spent hours ironing out the details and gameplay mechanics; imagining and re-imagining different ways the various features of the game would interact with one another. What came out of this melding of the minds was a system where no mechanic existed in isolation. A system where the user had to think about not only their own strategy, but their opponent's as well. We wanted players to have to be cognizant of how their available resources of speed, stamina, and strength would determine the outcome of each battle. With the addition of weapons and armor we added another layer of tactical challenge; all without the overdone hit points model.<br/><br/>We wish you luck on your path to Rome and hope you have as much fun playing our app as we did creating it!
